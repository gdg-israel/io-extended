      | <b>DevFestFamily</b> is a tech conference for the whole family, <u>whether you are a programmer or not</u>!
      | Our goal is to teach Utahns to better appreciate code. We will have classes and activities for kids, teens,
      | and adults. Even those adults not interested in coding, but want to learn how to protect and guide their family
      | in these highly technical times.
    p
      | Please bring your family and friends, and let us teach them to code, and get some free lunch we you are at it.
      | Thanks to our generous sponsors, we wil be providing lunch and t-shirts to all who attend. We also will have
      | some amazing door prizes. We are hoping to give away a Raspberry Pi to each family that attends. If you have any
      | questions, please direct them to <a href="mailto:info@devfestfam.com">info@devfestfam.com</a>.
